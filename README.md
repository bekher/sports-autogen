# Sports-Autogen
### This small webapp uses Markov chains to generate short, sound-byte post-game interviews you would hear on ESPN.

While watching the 2016 Olympics, I noticed that all of the athlete post-competition interviews sound very generic and similar. Generally, all post-game interviews for any sport use plenty of cliches, making it a perfect application for demonstrating the beauty of Markov chains.

*Sample output:*
> We have to shore up their offensive production. We're tickled to contain them. Execution wise we really gave it is possible. We have a tremendous work ethic. They have kept their heads up through the difficult times. We have to play with their mental toughness. Theyâ€™ve come together as best and had a tough but not break. We have to stick to their bread-and-butter offense.
